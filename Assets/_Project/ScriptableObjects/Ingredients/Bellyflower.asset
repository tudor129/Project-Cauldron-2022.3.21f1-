  _description: A whimsical bloom of the arcane world, grows exclusively in the belly
    of the gargantuan Bellus Toad. Its petals, a soft iridescent lavender, undulate
    gently with the creature's movements, emitting a soothing, lullaby-like hum.
    Harvested under crescent moons, these ethereal blossoms are coveted for their
    dream-walking and emotion-soothing properties, but be cautious, for their scent
    carries a strong, intoxicating sweetness that can bewitch the senses.
